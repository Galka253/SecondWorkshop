            When most people think of music theory, they imagine something dry
            and boring. Struggling to read the black dots on paper, learning how
            to draw a treble clef, wondering what a

            is and what on earth you’re meant to do with it. Eventually, most
            people give up. It’s more fun to grab your instrument and make some
            noise. That’s why you started learning music, anyway. The real
            problem isn’t the music theory.

            You’re a contemporary musician. You play in a band. Learning the C
            clef is probably not going to help you achieve your musical goals.

        <h3>Practice this exercise to develop essential music theory</h3>
        <p>
          Because music is a language, you have to use it consistently to
          develop fluency. It took me 10 years of learning and doing music
          before I’d been in enough different musical situations that the theory
          I was using came second nature to me. When I was tutoring the class at
          uni, I wanted a way to fast track this process. They needed to be
          exposed to scales, keys, chords, and intervals on a regular basis, so
          I had them do this exercise.
